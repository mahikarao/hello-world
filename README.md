# hello-world
If you know hindi, this repository is my SHAGUN. (Must have for a good start :D).
Recently, I discovered that I don't dislike coding like I thought I did. I just didn't give it a chance before..
So now, I like to understand the how a function is working at the back internally and not just the task that can be accomplished by using it.
